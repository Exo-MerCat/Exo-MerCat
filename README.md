# Exo-MerCat: The Exoplanet Merged Catalog

Exo-MerCat collects data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, the Exoplanet Encyclopaedia, the Open Exoplanet Catalog, the TESS Objects of Interest Catalog, and the Kepler/K2 Objects of Interest Catalog. It automatically identifies duplicated entries in the data and selects the most precise measurements for all the available planetary parameters.
